		- configure: error: off_t undefined; check your library configuration

		The off_t type is defined in the header file unistd.h.
		The 32-bit system is programmed into long int, while the 64-bit system is compiled into long int.
		When compiling, the default is to find 64-bit dynamic link libraries.
		But by default, centos‘s dynamic link library configuration file / etc / ld. so. conf does not include a search path.
		At this point, you need to add / usr / local / lib64 / usr / lib64 library file paths for 64 bits.

		# Add search path to configuration file
echo '/usr/local/lib64
/usr/local/lib
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64'>>/etc/ld.so.conf
		# and then update the configuration
ldconfig -v
		usr/local/include/zip.h:59:21: fatal error: zipconf.h: No such file or directory
		cp /usr/local/lib/libzip/include/zipconf.h /usr/local/include/zipconf.h
